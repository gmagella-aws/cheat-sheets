# No IAM users in the Account 
 
# Description: 
# When Active Directory Federation is used, there should be no reason for IAM users to exist in the account. 
 
# Rationale: 
 
# AD Federation allows users to assume a temporary role in the AWS account. If IAM users are used it might indicate that the account has been compromised. 
 
# This policy will send a notification to Security Hub if IAM users are created in the account.
